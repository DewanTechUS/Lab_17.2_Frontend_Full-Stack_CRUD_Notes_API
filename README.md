## Reflection

I built this frontend to strengthen my React skills and improve my full-stack portfolio. During development, I faced challenges related to API integration, state management, and UI clarity.

By separating frontend and backend concerns, I found it easier to debug issues and maintain the application. React’s component-based structure helped me isolate problems quickly and improve the overall user experience.

## Special thanks to my instructors and learning community for their guidance and feedback throughout this project.
